> My Experience so far at Axon
>> Designed and implemented a correlation Id system, that generates an UUID during electron app start in the main process, which
is used to keep track of an entire user session by passing the Id from electron main process to renderer process and shared
worker.
>> Implemented a metric system to gauge the performance of the app by analyzing app reloads, app starts, and app errors.
>> Implemented a tool which helps in keeping track of how many requests are being stalled for a user during a hotswap process.
>> Implemented dashboards and alerts in grafana and splunk to monitor the performance of the app.
